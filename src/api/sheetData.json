    "text": "The $500 Wedding Scam - I once loaned my cousin $500 because she was convinced her backyard wedding would be a \"profit event.\" The plan was to charge guests $20 for a barbecue buffet and have a pay bar. She swore she would not only pay it back, she would make money. In the end, 30 people showed up, half of them kids, who, naturally, didn't pay. The groom's uncle got so drunk that he blew up the makeshift bar, and the neighbors called the police, thinking it was an illegal street party. I never saw that $500."

    "text": "Dad's $1,200 Magic Beans - When I was 10, my dad bought “the future of agriculture” — $1,200 worth of chia seeds he bought from a shady vendor on the side of the road. He was sure he could grow and sell them as a “sustainable business.” Spoiler: He didn’t even plant them. The bags just sat in the garage until I found them a few years later… with mice inside. I still tease him about his “million dollar chia empire.”"

    "text": "Pizza for Bitcoins - In 2010, my roommate suggested we split the cost of two pizzas. He said, “Let’s pay with Bitcoin! It’s only $10!” I didn’t understand anything about cryptocurrency back then, and I didn’t want to figure it out — I just wanted to eat. Fast forward to 2021, and he reminds me that those pizzas cost us about 50 bitcoins… which is now worth almost a million dollars. And that’s how I blew my chance to get rich for two pepperonis."

But one day we sat down to go through her bills and found out she had paid over $5,000 in interest due to late payments. Now, when I ask her about financial life hacks, she turns away with the phrase: “Shut up about this cashback!”"

He once spent $2,000 to make “the most popular cat page on Facebook.” His plan was to make money from advertising and cute cat merchandise. He hired a photographer, bought expensive costumes for the cats, and even ordered advertising for the page. But the cats simply ran away from him, and he only got 500 subscribers, 300 of which were our relatives. Now, every time he sees a cat, he grumbles: “They ruined my business.”"

    "text": "The “brilliant” idea of the neighbor with gold - My neighbor Jim once bought a $3,000 metal detector, confident he would find gold on the beaches. He spent two months, every weekend, digging in the sand. One day, he came running to me waving his “find” — a broken gold chain. We had it checked by a jeweler and it turned out to be cheap costume jewelry alloy, worth $10. Jim tried to sell the metal detector for $2,000, but it ended up being sold for $500. Now he calls me a \"dream killer\" because I was the first to tell him that there was no gold on the beaches."

    "text": "My son's school \"exchange\" - My 12 year old son decided to “make money” at school. He took $100, bought a pack of gum and chocolates on sale, and then started selling them to his classmates at a markup. Things were going well until the teacher noticed that the kids were constantly chewing. Parents complained that their children were bringing home long lists of “debts.” The school called me, and I heard the phrase: “Your son has organized an underground market.” It all ended with the confiscation of goods and a stern talk about “proper business management.” But at least he managed to hide part of the profit!"

Three months later, the company declared bankruptcy. When Mom found out, she asked, “What kind of investor is this in the family?” Dad denied it for a long time, and then said that he “didn’t buy it for the money, but to feel the excitement!” Yes, the feeling for $10,000 is powerful."

    "text": "$5,000 Wedding Cake - When we got married, my wife insisted on ordering “the most beautiful wedding cake in town.” It cost $5,000—a sum that seemed crazy to me, but I didn’t argue. At our wedding, one of our nephews dropped the top tier of the cake while trying to grab a photo. When I looked at the mess, my wife whispered, “I hope you don’t remember this…” Spoiler: I still remember."

    "text": "My eBay epic - In 2005, I saw an ad on eBay: “Genuine Antique Coins – A Dream Collection!” The price was only $1,200. I thought it was a good investment and bought them. When they arrived, I realized that I had been deceived. The coins turned out to be replicas that were sold in any souvenir shop for $5. Since then, I have not bought “antiques” on the Internet, and my friends still joke: “So, are you a collector?”"

He promised that I would be able to impress my friends and make a lot of money. I paid, and he showed me how to pull a coin out from behind my ear. Yes, for $50. I tried this “trick” in front of my friends, and everyone said, “We’ve seen this before.” I think it was the most expensive “surprise” of my life."

He bought expensive dog costumes, lighting equipment, and even hired a “promotion consultant” for $3,000. The dog just didn't want to be filmed. In every video, she either ran away or ruined the costumes. My brother has only 40 subscribers, and all the videos got 3 likes. Now we call him \"Hollywood Producer\" for this failed project."

A month later, the stock plummeted by 80%. It turned out the company was under investigation for using “gray” technologies. Mom claims that “it’s just a temporary problem,” although the stock has been trading at $0.01 for six months."
